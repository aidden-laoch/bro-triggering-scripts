# This is a list of things that you want to be replaced in traffic
# The syntax is as follows (use <<>> as the delimiter beween the text and replacement):
# (string to replace) <<>> (what to replace it with)
# 
# Examples:
#   - Replace the following line with the modified line
#	Successful su for root by root<<>>Successful su for testuser1 by testuser2
#
#   - Replace all occurences of "root" with "testuser777"
#	root<<>>testuser777
#
#   - Drop all messages containing the specified text
#	root:root<<>>DROP
#
# The replacements are cumulative (multipel sed replacements will be used), so be sure
# to place the search strings below in the order that you want them to be replaced.

root:root<<>>DROP
Successful su for root by root<<>>Successful su for testuser1 by testuser2
